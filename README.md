# Drug-Sales-Forecasting

## Pharmaceuticals in Business Analytics

## Overview
The goal is to develop a robust algorithm to forecast the future sales for a portfolio of two drugs sold in 25 accounts across 5 countries. The drug sales are largely impacted by the account potential, demographics, market factors, company's promotional expenditures and key product launches. The idea is to leverage the historical montlhly data pertinent to the year 2011 to 2018, derive insights from it and give possible sales numbers for the year 2019. 

This documentation is to curate my approach followed and methodology adopted in the workflow.
